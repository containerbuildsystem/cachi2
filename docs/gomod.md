## Specifying modules to process

```shell
cachi2 fetch-deps \
  --source ./my-repo \
  --output ./cachi2-output \
  '<modules JSON>'
```

Module[^misnomer] JSON:

```jsonc
{
  // "gomod" tells Cachi2 to process a go module
  "type": "gomod",
  // path to the module (relative to the --source directory)
  // defaults to "."
  "path": "."
}
```

The main argument accepts alternative forms of input, see [usage: pre-fetch-dependencies][usage-prefetch].

[^misnomer]: You may have noticed a slight naming issue. You use the main argument, also called PKG, to specify a *module* to
  process. Even worse, Go has packages as well (see [gomod vs go-package](#gomod-vs-go-package)). What gives?
  As far as we know, most languages/package managers use the opposite naming. For example, in [Python][py-modules],
  modules are `*.py` files, packages are collections of modules. In [npm][npm-modules], modules are directories/files
  you can `require()`, packages are the top-level directories with `package.json`. In Cachi2, we stick to the more
  common naming.

## Using fetched dependencies

See also [usage.md](usage.md) for a complete example of Cachi2 usage.

Cachi2 downloads the required modules into the deps/gomod/ subpath of the output directory (`cachi2-output/deps/gomod`).
Further down the file tree, at `cachi2-output/deps/gomod/pkg/mod`, is a directory formatted as the Go
[module cache](https://go.dev/ref/mod#module-cache).

```text
cachi2-output/deps/gomod/pkg/mod
└── cache
    └── download
        ├── github.com
        │   └── ...
        └── golang.org
            └── ...
```

To use this module cache during your build, set the GOMODCACHE environment variable. Cachi2 generates GOMODCACHE along
with other expected environment variables for you. See [usage: generate environment variables][usage-genenv] for more
details.

For more information on Go's environment variables:

```shell
go help environment
```

Note that the deps/gomod/ layout described above does not apply when using [vendoring](#vendoring). With vendoring
enabled, deps/gomod/ will be an empty directory. Instead, dependencies will be inside the vendor subdirectory of your
module.

```text
my-repo
└── vendor
    ├── github.com
    │   └── ...
    ├── golang.org
    │   └── ...
    └── modules.txt
```

Go will use the vendored dependencies automatically, but it's not a bad idea to set the environment variables generated
by Cachi2 anyway.

## gomod flags

The `cachi2 fetch-deps` command accepts the following gomod-related flags:

* [--cgo-disable](#--cgo-disable)
* [--force-gomod-tidy](#--force-gomod-tidy)

### --cgo-disable

Makes Cachi2 internally disable [cgo](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/cgo) while processing your Go modules. Typically, you would
want to use this flag if your modules *do* use C code and Cachi2 is failing to process them. Cachi2 will not attempt to
disable cgo in your build (nor should you disable it yourself if you rely on C).

Disabling cgo should not prevent Cachi2 from fetching your Go dependencies as usual. Note that Cachi2 will not make any
attempts to fetch missing C libraries. If required, you would need to get them through other means.

### --force-gomod-tidy

Makes Cachi2 run `go mod tidy` after downloading dependencies.

⚠ This flag is questionable and may be removed in the future.

## Vendoring

Go supports [vendoring](https://go.dev/ref/mod#vendoring) to store the source code of all dependencies in the vendor/
directory alongside your module. Before go 1.17, `go mod vendor` used to download fewer dependencies than
`go mod download`. Starting with 1.17, that is no longer true - see the [overview][readme-gomod] in the README.

We generally discourage vendoring, but Cachi2 does support processing repositories that contain vendored content. In
this case, instead of a regular prefetching of dependencies, Cachi2 will only validate if the contents of the vendor
directory are consistent with what `go mod vendor` would produce.

### Deprecated flags

Cachi2's behavior towards vendoring used to be governed by two flags:

* `--gomod-vendor`
* `--gomod-vendor-check`

Both are deprecated and will have no effect when set. They are only kept for backwards compatibility reasons.

## Understanding reported dependencies

Cachi2 reports two (arguably three) different types of dependencies in the generated SBOM for your Go modules:

* **gomod** dependencies (Go modules)
* **go-package** dependencies (Go packages)
  * from the downloaded modules
  * from the [standard library](#stdlib-dependencies)

### gomod vs go-package

Best explained by the Go [modules documentation][go-modules-overview]:

> A module is a collection of packages that are released, versioned, and distributed together.

Your Go code imports individual *packages*, which come from *modules*. You might import a single package from a module
that provides many, but Go (and Cachi2) has to download the whole module anyway. Effectively, modules are the smallest
"unit of distribution." Go does have the ability to list the individual packages that your project imports. Cachi2 makes
use of this ability to report both the downloaded modules and the required packages.

The list of **go-package** dependencies reported by Cachi2 is the full set of packages (transitively) required by your
project. *⚠ If any of your module dependencies is [missing a checksum](#missing-checksums) in go.sum, the list may be
incomplete.*

The list of **gomod** dependencies is the set of modules that Cachi2 downloaded to satisfy the go-package dependencies.

Note that versioning applies to modules, not packages. When reporting the versions of Go packages, Cachi2 uses the
version of the module that provides the package.

#### How to match a package to a module?

Borrowing from the [modules documentation][go-modules-overview] again:

> For example, the module "golang.org/x/net" contains a package in the directory "html". That package’s path is
  "golang.org/x/net/html"

The name of a package starts with the name of the module that provides it.

#### In the source tree, what are modules? What are packages?

To simplify a little:

* Does the directory have a `go.mod` file? It's a module (provides packages).
* Does the directory have any `*.go` files? It's a package (is importable).
* Does it have both? It's both a module and a package.

### stdlib dependencies

Go is able to list even the standard library packages that your project imports. Cachi2 exposes these as **go-package**
dependencies, with caveats. Cachi2 uses some version of Go to list the dependencies. This may or may not be the same
version that you will use to build your project. We do not presume that the versions would be the same, hence why:

* the reported stdlib packages may be slightly inaccurate (e.g. new packages in new Go versions)
* the versions of stdlib packages are not reported

#### What identifies stdlib dependencies in the go-package list?

* does not have a version
* the name does not start with a hostname
  * `io/fs` - standard library
  * `golang.org/x/net` - external

### Missing checksums

Go stores the checksums of all your dependency modules in the [go.sum file][go-sum-file]. Go typically manages this
file entirely on its own, but if any of your dependencies do end up missing, it can cause issues for Cachi2 and for
Go itself.

For Cachi2, a missing checksum means that the offending module gets downloaded without checksum verification (or with
partial checksum verification - Cachi2 does consult the [Go checksum database][gosumdb]). Due to `go list` behavior,
it also means that the [go-package](#gomod-vs-go-package) dependency listing may be incomplete[^why-incomplete].

<!-- TODO: link the cachi2:missing_hash:in_file property once the taxonomy doc exists -->

For Go, a missing checksum will cause the `go build` or `go run` commands to fail.

Please make sure to keep your go.sum file up to date, perhaps by incorporating the `go mod tidy` command in your dev
workflow.

[^why-incomplete]: When a module does not have a checksum in go.sum, the `go list` command returns only basic
  information and an error for the packages from said module. Go doesn't return any information about the dependencies
  of the affected packages. This can cause Cachi2 to miss the transitive package dependencies of packages from
  checksum-less modules.

### Go 1.21+ *(since cachi2-v0.5.0)*
  Starting with [Go 1.21][go121-changelog], Go changed the meaning of the `go 1.X` directive in
  that it now specifies the [minimum required version](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-go) of Go
  rather than a suggested version as it originally did. The format of the version string in the
  `go` directive now also includes the micro release and if you don't include the micro release in
  your `go.mod` file yourself (i.e. you only specify the language release) Go will try to correct
  it automatically inside the file. Last but not least, Go 1.21 also introduced a new keyword
  [`toolchain`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-mod-file-toolchain) to the `go.mod` file. What this all
  means in practice for end users is that you may not be able to process your `go.mod` file with an
  older version of Go (and hence older cachi2) as you could in the past for various reasons.
  Many projects bump their required Go toolchain's micro release as soon as it becomes available
  upstream (i.e. not waiting for distributions to bundle them properly). This caused problems for
  *cachi2-v0.5.0* because the container image's version simply may not have been high enough to
  process a given project's `go.mod` file. Therefore, *cachi2-v0.7.0* implemented a mechanism to
  always rely on the origin 0th release of a toolchain (e.g. 1.21.0) and use the `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`
  setting to instruct Go to fetch any toolchain as specified by the `go.mod` file automatically,
  hence allowing us to keep up with frequent micro version bumps. **Note that such a language
  version would still need to be officially marked as supported by cachi2, i.e. we'd not allow Go
  to fetch e.g. a 1.22 toolchain if the maximum supported Go version by cachi2 were 1.21!**
