# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

 We actively maintain and support the latest version of the project. Security updates are only
 provided for the latest release.

 | Older   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability or even **think** you may have discovered one, we
encourage you to report it to us. Please follow the GitHub Security
Advisory feature's process described in the [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability). 

Once the report is submitted, it will only be visible to the advisory collaborators (you) and
repository admins.

## What Happens Next

- The admins will review your report and may reach out for further information.
- If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix in a private space (collaboration
welcome). You'll be able to follow the whole process.
- Once resolved, the issue will be disclosed responsibly and the fix released promptly.

Thank you for helping us maintain a secure project!
